## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive design blueprint for the `Receipts` Client application. It details the pages and components necessary to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for various view models, including `AccountVM`, `ReceiptVM`, `TransactionVM`, and `ReceiptItemVM`. The application is designed to offer an intuitive and efficient user experience for managing receipts, accounts, transactions, and trips. It leverages aggregate view models like `ReceiptWithItemsVM` and `TransactionAccountVM` to streamline data associations and ensure data integrity.

## Architecture Overview

The Client application follows a modular architecture, promoting separation of concerns and scalability. The key architectural components include:

- **Presentation Layer**: Built using Blazor for constructing interactive web UI with C#.

- **Real-Time Communication**: Implements SignalR to facilitate real-time updates and notifications.
- **State Management**: Managed through scoped services and context providers to maintain application state efficiently.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations and data synchronization.

### Component Hierarchy

- **Pages**: High-level components representing different sections of the application (e.g., Home, Manage Trips).
- **Layouts**: Define the common structure (e.g., Navigation Menu, Header) applied across multiple pages.
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (e.g., DateOnlyPicker, Tables, Forms).
- **Services**: Handle business logic, API communication, and real-time data handling (e.g., SignalRService).
- **ViewModels**: Represent data structures used across the application for data binding and manipulation.
