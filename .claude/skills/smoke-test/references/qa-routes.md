| 1 | `/login` | Login | Sign In | Public |
| 2 | `/change-password` | ChangePassword | Change Password | Authenticated (must-reset only) |

## Protected Routes (Layout, requires auth)

|---|------|------|-------------|--------|
| 3 | `/` | Dashboard | Dashboard | User |
| 4 | `/accounts` | Accounts | Accounts | User |
| 5 | `/categories` | Categories | Categories | User |

## Route Notes

- **`/change-password`** only renders the form when `mustResetPassword` is true. If the user doesn't need a password change, it redirects to `/`. For smoke testing, just verify the URL doesn't error -- don't expect the form to be visible.
- **`/receipts/:id`** requires a valid receipt UUID in the path. Without a valid ID, it shows a loading state or error. Verify the page loads without errors using a known receipt ID.
- **`/receipts/new`** is the 4-step wizard. For smoke testing, just verify step 1 loads with the "Trip Details" card.
- **Admin routes** (`/audit`, `/trash`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/backup`) require the logged-in user to have an admin role. The seeded `admin@receipts.local` user is an admin.
- **Auth guard behavior**: Unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to `/login`. Non-admin access to admin routes redirects to `/` (dashboard).

## Removed Routes (historical)

The following routes were removed as part of RECEIPTS-504. They previously redirected to `/receipts`:

- `/receipt-items` -- consolidated into `/receipts`
- `/transactions` -- consolidated into `/receipts`
- `/trips` -- consolidated into `/receipts`
- `/receipt-detail` -- replaced by `/receipts/:id`
- `/transaction-detail` -- consolidated into `/receipts`

The following route was removed as part of RECEIPTS-710 (OCR receipt-scanning feature retired):

- `/receipts/scan` -- the OCR scan page; manual entry at `/receipts/new` is the supported path
